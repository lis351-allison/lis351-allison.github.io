        <h1>Sports</h1>
        <p>Sports are something that I have been interested in my entire life. I am an incredibly passionate fan of my teams and love spending my free time watching sports. Playing and watching sports is also something that brings my friends and me closer together. Outside of cheering for all of UW-Madison's sports teams, my three favorite professional sports teams are the Indiana Pacers, Chicago Blackhawks, and Chicago Cubs. Below I will share some information about each of these teams.</p>

                <p>The Indiana Pacers are a professional basketball team in the National Basketball Association. The team was founded in 1967 and play their home games in downtown Indianapolis. Currently, their owner is Herb Simon and their head coach is Rick Carlisle. This season, they are having a successful season led by their star players, Tyrese Haliburton and Pascal Siakam. Unfortunately, they have never won an NBA championship but they are one of the historic franchises. Their greatest all time player is Reggie Miller who is one of many incredible players to have played in Indiana. Many people are surprised to learn that I am a Pacers fan because I am from Chicago, but my favorite player as a kid was Paul George, who played for the Pacers, so I became a big fan of them. I am excited for the playoffs this season and hope they can make a run.</p>

                <p>The Chicago Blackhawks are a professional Hockey team in the National Hockey League. The team was founded in 1926 and play their home games in downtown Chicago. The Blackhawks are one of the Original 6 hockey teams in the NHL and have one of the most storied histories in the league. When I was a kid, they were one of the most successful teams in all sports. They won the Stanley Cup in 2010, 2013, and 2015. Those teams included some of the best players in the league, including Patrick Kane, Jonathan Toews, and Duncan Keith. Currently, the Blackhawks are going through tough times as they have been one of the worst teams in the league for the last few years. They have some exciting young players including Connor Bedard who is one of the most anticipated stars in the league. The Blackhawks will always have a special place in my heart as they provided my childhood with so many great memories such as going to games with my dad.</p>

                <p>The Chicago Cubs are a professional baseball team in Major League Baseball. The team was founded in 1870 and play their home games in downtown Chicago. Their ballpark is called Wrigley Field and is one of the most famous ballparks in the world. Wrigley Field is known for its iconic ivy grass on the outfield wall. The Cubs had one of the most infamous droughts as they had gone 108 years without winning a World Series until 2016 when they finally broke the curse. I vividly remember being with my friends watching the game when they finally won it all and it is one of the best memories I have. The Cubs recently opened up the 2025 MLB season playing two games against the Dodgers in Tokyo, Japan. Those two teams were chosen because they have some of the best Japanese players on their rosters. Going to Wrigely during the summer with friends or family is one of my favorite ways to spend a sunny summer day. </p>
