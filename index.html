    <h1>Kevin Allison's Personal Website</h1>
    <h2>Quick Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Kevin Allison, and this website is all about me. This website is a project for one of my courses at UW-Madison called LIS 351. I have been learning all about HTML and CSS and this website is where I will put my skills to use. Here, you'll find information about my education, my hobbies, my favorite sports teams, and the foods I love. You can use the links at the bottom of the page to find more information. Feel free to explore!</p>
