    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>Having hobbies is something that is super important in everyone's life. As I have grown, my hobbies and interests have evolved. As a kid, I was very interested in things like Pokemon which was something that many of my friends and I bonded over. I always find it interesting to learn about other people's hobbies because they are so passionate about them. Two of my favorite hobbies are solving Rubik's Cubes and doing Jigsaw Puzzles.</p>

            <h2>Rubik's Cube</h2>
            <p>Solving Rubik's cubes is something that has been a hobby of mine for a long time. It begin with me and my friend both trying to learn how to solve in. Once we were able to solve it, we became competing to see who could solve it the fastest. What is so interesting about the Rubik's cube is that there are so many unique ways to solve it. As my passion for the cube grew, I begin learning how to solve the bigger cubes including the 4x4 and the 5x5. These cubs are very unique and require a lot of algorithms to solve.</p>

            <h2>Jigsaw Puzzles</h2>
            <p>Jigsaw Puzzles have always been something that my family and I have enjoyed doing. Our dining room table is often covered with pieces of a puzzle that we are working on. Working on a puzzle is a great way to spend time with family members because it is a very relaxing and calm task. It is always fun to find fun puzzles with interesting pictures. Additionally, making custom puzzles is really cool because you can take any picture and turn it into a fun game. Some of my favorite puzzles are from the New Yorker. </p>
