    <h1>My Education</h1>
    <p>As a senior at UW-Madison, my education is a central component of my personality. I am finishing my degree in biology as I plan to continue my education in medical school. I am incredibly proud to be a student at UW-Madison and am so grateful for everything that this school and campus has provided for me. I try to be as involved in the UW-Madison community as much as possible, both inside and outside the classroom.</p>

    <h2>Courses</h2>
    <p>Throughout my undergraduate career, I have taken many interesting courses. From core science courses to intriguing electives, I have learned so much in the last four years. My favorite science course I have taken is Biochemistry. This class was so interesting and taught me so many of the unique concepts and principles that I plan to bring into my future profession. One of the most fun classes I have taken is Jewish 355. The content of this course was very engaging, but what made this class so fun was that I got to take it with my brother. He is two years older than me, and this was the first time we ever got to take a course together. As I finish my last semester, I am taking more interesting courses, including L I S 351.</p>

    <h2>Extracurriculars</h2>
    <p>Outside of the classroom, I have been so fortunate to be involved in many student organizations. One of the main student organizations I am in is the Peer Learning Association. This is a club that provides free tutoring in many science courses. I spent many semesters as a facilitator for these tutoring sessions and am now serving on the executive board for the club. My time in PLA has taught me so much about teaching and communication, which are very important skills. The link to the Wisconsin Involvement Network site for PLA is below. Another club I am involved in is the Brain Exercise Initiative. This is a new club at Madison that allows students to volunteer at the Capitol Lakes Living Center to work with elderly patients with Alzheimer's. Volunteers spend an hour with a resident doing mental exercises to help cognitive function. All of the clubs I have been involved in have taught me so many things, and I would recommend all new students to become as involved as possible.
